      <description>&amp;ldquo;Physicist&amp;rdquo;.
That was my answer as a kid, whenever someone used to ask me what I wanted to be when I grew up.
I didn&amp;rsquo;t know what it meant. To this day I don&amp;rsquo;t. I just knew that physics as a subject fascinated me, and I just wanted to have some career path in physics, because I would get to do it all day. But I had no idea what it meant to have a career in physics.</description>

      <description>Anytime you hear someone talk about the unidirectionality of time, the introduction goes something like this - we can go forward or backwards in space, but we can go only forward in time. And then they go on to explain that one can travel left or right, east or west, and that is the how we all can see that the movement in space is “bidirectional” - forward and backwards. But the movement in time is unidirectional because we can only travel into the future, and not into the past.</description>
